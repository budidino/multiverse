      Dino Budimilic built the RandALL app as a commercial app with optional subscriptions
      and a one time lifetime purchase.

    <p>
      RandALL does not collect, store, or process any personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app works fully offline. No account is required and no personal information is
      requested or saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subscriptions and purchases are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store.
      RandALL does not have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or any personal
      data related to purchases.

    <p>
      The app may use anonymous and aggregated analytics to understand feature usage and
